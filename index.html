    <h2>Hello there</h2>

    <p>
      I'm Amine, a cloud engineer from Morocco. My main interests are software in the cloud, automation and containerization, and more generally distributed systems.

    <p>
      As you can see, I didn't put much effort into this website. I just wanted
      to have a webpage where I can put some infos.
